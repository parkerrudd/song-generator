# Song Generator React App 

**Version 1.0.0**

This is a react web app that randomly generates a song for the user based on their mood. 

## new-rendering-idea branch 

In the "new-rendering-idea" branch, the app uses a database that I put together on a JSON file to display the hyperlink for each song. This allows the user to then choose which platform they would prefer to listen to the song on. 

## spotifyVersion branch 

This branch is where I integrated the spotify API. I was able to use authentication tokens to allow users access to the mood playlists. The user then clicks on a mood and a random song from each playlist is generated for them to listen to a preview of.
